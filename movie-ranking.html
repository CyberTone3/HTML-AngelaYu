    <h1>The Best Movies According to...ME!!</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

    <hr />
    <h3>Brown Sugar</h3>
    <p>This is one of my favorite movies as it combines the love of Hip Hop (real Hip Hop) with romance, desire, hurt and growth. It's the story I wish I had for my future children.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>Love and Basketball</h3>
    <p>This sould have been the first movie I picked, because it is my absolute favorite movie. I loved it as if it were my story. I could talk your ears off about this movie so I'ma just say, it's a MUST SEE!</p>
    <br />
    <h3>Transformers (All of them)</h3>
    <p>You know what makes an exceptional movie of show to me... all the elements of an honorable individual or group of people. I love the love, loyalty, growth and true friendship in these movies. It's what I wish I could find in the people I keep around me. You get the picture. ... Plus, it's ACTION PACKED!!!</p>
